    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hey, there! I’m Lukas, a PhD student in computational biology shared between
      ETH Zürich (D-BSSE) and Roche (IHB). I specialize in computational genomics, systems biology, and machine learning applications. 
      For my PhD studies I want to decode how gene regulatory networks are rewired in the intestine and which components are truly unique
      to humans. For that I'm using single-cell multi-omics, perturbation & comparative genomics data.
